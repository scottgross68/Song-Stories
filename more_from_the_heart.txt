More From the Heart is an album about endurance.

It reflects the quiet decision to remain open after loss, disappointment, and unanswered questions. These songs were written from lived moments. Love offered without guarantees. Grief that arrived faster than it could be processed. The steady work of continuing forward when life did not unfold as expected.

This album does not rush pain away. It allows grief to exist alongside strength. It recognizes survival as something practiced daily rather than claimed. At its center, this album is about choosing honesty over hardening and giving what remains even after so much has already been given.

These songs reflect a life lived with intention. Loving deeply. Grieving honestly. Measuring worth through presence rather than outcome. What matters most here is what was shared.
