“Her Heart Is Pure” was inspired by a woman who had endured years of betrayal, abuse, and disappointment, yet somehow never lost her light. She had every reason to shut down, but she didn’t.

I wrote this song because I saw her strength before she saw it herself. She was raising her kids, holding herself together, and trying to heal without knowing if she could ever trust again.

This song is about honoring the goodness that survives even after everything tries to take it away. It’s about recognizing a heart that stays pure, not because life was kind, but because she refused to let it harden her.
