“You Are the Reason” was written during a turning point in my life. I was in a place where I needed direction, purpose, and something to believe in. Meeting her changed how I saw my future and what I thought I was capable of becoming.

This song is about choosing a different path because someone made you want to be better. She became the reason I woke up differently, thought differently, and tried harder. Not because she asked me to, but because her presence made the choice clear.

Within a few months of meeting her, she was pregnant with Maverick, and everything shifted. This song captures the moment when one person becomes the reason you stand up and move forward.
