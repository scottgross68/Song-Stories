When We First Met

“When We First Met” was the first thing I ever wrote. I was 19, and it came from my first true love. I didn’t know what I was doing yet, but I knew what I was feeling, and writing it down was the only way I knew how to hold onto it.

This song came from that rush of connection in the beginning, the kind that makes you feel lighter, like everything is possible. It’s about the hope of thinking it could be forever, the trust you want to believe in, and the fear that shows up when you care more than you can explain.

Even though it didn’t work out, I never forgot what that felt like. This song is a snapshot of who I was at that age, and it’s still a piece of my heart from a chapter that shaped me more than I realized at the time.
