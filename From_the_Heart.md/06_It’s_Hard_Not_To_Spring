“It’s Hard Not to Spring” was written in the early days of getting to know Maverick’s mom. Everything felt exciting and new, and I was trying to balance falling fast with not wanting to unravel things before they had a chance to grow.

This song captures that rush of connection when you meet someone who immediately stands out. The feeling that she could be the one, even before you understand why. It’s playful, hopeful, and honest about how difficult it can be to slow your heart down.

Looking back, it marks the beginning of a chapter that would change my life in ways I couldn’t have imagined at the time.
