I wrote It’s Hard Not to Spring (When a Girl’s Got You Sprung) when I first met Maverick’s mom.

It captures that early rush of connection — the kind that catches you off guard and shifts your entire outlook in a matter of days. I remember feeling grounded one moment and completely rearranged the next. Conversations felt effortless. Time moved differently. Even ordinary moments carried weight.

The song reflects that mix of excitement and vulnerability that comes with realizing someone has gotten past your guard. There is a playful tone on the surface, but underneath it is something sincere — the recognition that love can arrive quickly and change you before you are ready.

Looking back, the song holds a snapshot of the beginning. Before life became complicated. Before loss reshaped everything. It preserves the feeling of new love — hopeful, electric, and full of possibility.

This song exists as a reminder that some seasons of life begin with joy so strong it feels impossible to ignore.
