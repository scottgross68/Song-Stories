“Can’t Live Without You” came from falling for someone who didn’t feel the same way. I didn’t plan it and I didn’t want it, but it happened slowly and then all at once.

She had been through a lot, and the strength she carried because of that drew me in. I wrote this song while stuck between hope and reality, wanting to stay, wanting to prove I could be trusted, while knowing she wasn’t ready or able to return those feelings.

This song isn’t about anger or drama. It’s about that quiet heartbreak that comes from loving deeply and having nowhere for that love to land.
