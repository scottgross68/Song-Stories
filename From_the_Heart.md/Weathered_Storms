Box of Memories

This is the most personal song I’ve ever written.

It came from a kind of grief that isn’t just about losing someone, but about losing an entire future you were already living in your heart. Maverick was real. He was already part of our world. His heartbeat, the pictures, the plans, the quiet moments where everything felt possible.

When he was gone, what remained were boxes. One held memories. One held him. Walking away with those instead of the life I imagined is something that never really leaves you.

Writing this song was the only way I knew how to hold onto him without being swallowed by the pain. It’s not about letting go. It’s about learning how to carry love forward in a different form.

Maverick changed me. He softened parts of me I didn’t know existed. He taught me to notice the world differently, to move more gently through it, and to understand compassion in a deeper way.

This song is my letter to him. He’s not just a memory in a box. He’s the reason I became who I am.
