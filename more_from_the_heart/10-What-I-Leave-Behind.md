What I Leave Behind is about legacy shaped through presence.

I did not raise children of my own. This song reflects the understanding that a life still carries meaning through the way care is given to others. Through friendship. Through quiet acts of support. Through staying present during difficult moments.

It reflects a life lived simply. Finding meaning in ordinary acts of love. Choosing openness over bitterness. Giving what remains even when life follows unexpected paths.

This song is not about absence.
It is about what was given.

A quiet life lived honestly leaves a mark.
