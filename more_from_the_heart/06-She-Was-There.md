I wrote She Was There for my mom.

This song reflects a love that shows up consistently across a lifetime. It remembers moments that quietly shape who we become. Being fed and held. Being allowed to fail and learn. Being encouraged even when sacrifice was required.

The memories within this song include music lessons, long drives, and small spaces that somehow held big dreams. It honors a mother who supported creativity because it mattered, not because it was easy.

This song is about consistency and presence.
It is a thank you for believing, staying, and loving without conditions.
