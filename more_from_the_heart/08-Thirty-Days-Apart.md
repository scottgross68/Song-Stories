Thirty Days Apart was written about losing my son Maverick and my mom within thirty days of each other.

This song comes directly from moments that remain vivid. Holding a child for the first time while saying goodbye. Standing beside a mother while believing strength could protect her.

The losses arrived too close together to process separately. One life never had the chance to begin. One life had been a steady presence for decades. Grief collapsed time and left little room for recovery.

This song exists to name what happened and to carry love forward.
