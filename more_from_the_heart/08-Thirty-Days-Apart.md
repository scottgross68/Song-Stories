There are moments in life that divide everything into before and after.

This song was written about a stretch of time that changed me permanently.

I lost my son during labor. I held him knowing I would never watch him grow. There are no words that prepare a father for that moment. You go from anticipation to silence in the span of hours. The future you were building disappears before it ever begins.

Thirty days later, I lost my mom.

Grief does not wait its turn. It does not space itself out kindly. It arrived again before I had even learned how to stand up from the first loss. The woman who gave me life was suddenly gone right after the child I never got to raise.

In one month, I became a father and a son in a completely different way.

This song carries the weight of helplessness. The reality that love cannot override mortality. The questions that sit in the quiet after hospitals empty and phone calls stop. It reflects what it feels like to survive something you never imagined surviving.

But it is also about connection.

I believe love does not end. I believe relationships do not disappear simply because breath does. I carry both of them with me in everything I do. In the way I think. In the way I love. In the way I create.

“Thirty Days Apart” is not just about loss. It is about the imprint that remains after loss. The way two lives, separated by a month, reshaped mine forever.

Some people mark time by years.

I mark mine by that month.
