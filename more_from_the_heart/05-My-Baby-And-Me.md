My Baby And Me was written in response to a tragedy involving the teenage daughter of someone I knew growing up. She was struck by a drunk driver while riding her bicycle.

I wrote this song from empathy. I imagined what it must feel like to wake each day carrying trauma that never should have occurred. The song speaks to disbelief and helplessness experienced by both the victim and the family who carries the aftermath together.

It also acknowledges resilience. Strength that rises quietly. Community that shows up when language fails.

This song exists to stand beside someone when answers remain absent.
