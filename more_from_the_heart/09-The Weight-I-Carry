The Weight I Carry is about living alongside grief rather than escaping it.

This song reflects quiet endurance. Carrying pain while trying to remain strong for another. Holding space for shared grief while containing personal sorrow. It acknowledges exhaustion, guilt, and the cost of loving deeply.

This song does not ask how survival happens. It accepts that survival continues one step at a time. It speaks to walking forward while carrying weight silently and allowing hope to exist gently.

Some weight remains. Strength grows through carrying it.
