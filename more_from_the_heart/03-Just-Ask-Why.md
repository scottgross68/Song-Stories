I wrote Just Ask Why after my son Maverick passed.

I was not searching for meaning when I wrote it. The song came from the moment grief begins and questions repeat without answers. It centers on a single word that echoes endlessly.

Why someone so young could be taken.
Why a life just beginning could end.
Why pain can make each breath feel heavy.

This song does not soften loss. It sits within it. It allows grief to speak without interruption. It gives voice to love with nowhere to go and to a heart trying to understand something beyond explanation.

This song exists to let grief speak freely.
