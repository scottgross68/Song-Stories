More Than You See is about being understood beyond appearances.

I wrote it after recognizing how easily people draw conclusions based on surface details. This song speaks for the experiences that remain unseen. Quiet struggles. Private loss. Strength that does not announce itself.

It invites patience. It asks for listening rather than assumption. It reflects acceptance that understanding from others is never guaranteed and that living truthfully does not require validation.

What matters here is truth lived openly.
