I'm Still Here is about a connection that formed gently and without expectation.

It reflects showing up authentically without pretending or fixing. The bond grew through honest conversation and shared vulnerability. There came a moment where presence mattered more than words, followed later by quiet absence without explanation.

This song carries steadiness rather than blame. It speaks to offering sincerity without demanding return. It honors meaning held even when connection ends.

Some connections remain unfinished. Honesty remains intact.
