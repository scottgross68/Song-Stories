I wrote I Did It Anyway when I realized how long I had been carrying the doubts of others.

For years I was encouraged toward safer paths and quieter choices. Wanting more creatively and emotionally was often treated as irresponsible. Some of those voices came from people close to me, and for a long time I allowed them to outweigh my own instincts.

This song lives between uncertainty and resolve. It reflects the decision to keep moving forward even when outcomes remain unclear. It speaks to showing up without guarantees and choosing persistence over permission.

Looking back, this song marks the moment I stopped asking approval to live honestly.
