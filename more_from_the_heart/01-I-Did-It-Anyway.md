“I Did It Anyway” was written out of the relationship I’ve had with my sister and the life I chose to live, even when it didn’t make sense to anyone else.

For most of my adult life, I’ve worked in mortgage loans. It’s commission based. There’s no guaranteed paycheck. No steady weekly number. And for years, that was the thing that came up again and again.

Her words still echo in my head:
“Why don’t you get a real job?”
“Why don’t you do something where you know how much money you’re making every week?”

My answer was always the same. I knew I could never make the kind of money I was capable of making by punching a clock. But knowing that didn’t make the road easier.

There were years of struggling. Years where I made bad decisions. Years where I was homeless, using drugs, and trying to survive while holding onto the belief that this path would eventually lead somewhere better. From the outside, it probably looked reckless or irresponsible. From the inside, it felt like the only thing I could stay true to.

This song isn’t about blaming anyone. It’s about living with doubt coming from the people closest to you and still choosing to trust yourself. It’s about failing publicly, falling hard, and continuing forward anyway because quitting would’ve meant abandoning who I believed I could become.

“I Did It Anyway” is me owning that the road I took wasn’t clean or easy, but it was mine. I stuck with it when it would’ve been easier to walk away. And eventually, it worked. Not overnight. Not without scars. But it worked.

This song is a reminder that sometimes success doesn’t come from doing what’s safe or understood. Sometimes it comes from surviving the years when nobody believes in you and proving, quietly, that you were right to keep going.

I did it anyway.
