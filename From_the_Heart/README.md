# From the Heart

From the Heart is an album about beginnings.

These songs were written in seasons of firsts. First loves. First losses. First realizations that life does not stay simple for long. The emotions here are unfiltered. Less guarded. Less practiced.

This album captures moments before experience turned into reflection. Before grief had vocabulary. Before resilience became necessary.

Where More From the Heart speaks from endurance, From the Heart speaks from immediacy.

These songs were written when feeling came before understanding.
