“Box of Memories” is the most personal song I’ve ever written. It came from losing Maverick and leaving the hospital without him, knowing I wouldn’t have him with me again until he was cremated.

We had already been living life with him in it. His heartbeat was recorded in a teddy bear. There were pictures of him inside his mom. He was real. He was ours. And then suddenly all that remained were two boxes. One filled with memories. One filled with him.

This song is about the grief of losing not just a child, but an entire future. It’s also about how that loss changed me. I began to see the world differently. Nature spoke in ways it never had before. Compassion lived where it hadn’t before.

Maverick isn’t just a memory in a box. He’s the reason I became who I am.
