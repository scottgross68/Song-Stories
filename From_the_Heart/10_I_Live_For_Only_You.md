“I Live For Only You” was written earlier in my life, during a time when love felt all-consuming. I had fallen hard for someone, believed everything was good between us, and then found out she wanted to see someone else.

It came out of confusion, shock, and the pain of realizing the future you thought you were building was never as solid as you believed. My heart felt exposed, and writing was the only way I knew how to process it.

This song reflects young love, vulnerability, and the kind of heartbreak that teaches you just how deeply you’re capable of feeling.
