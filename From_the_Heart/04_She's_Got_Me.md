“She’s Got Me” was also written about Maverick's mom, who didn’t realize how deeply she had already changed my life. She was strong, stubborn, and carried more than she ever let on. I admired her fire just as much as her softness.

At the time, I felt like all I had to offer her was myself. I didn’t see the value in what I brought, the way I saw what she gave to me. This song came from that imbalance, from loving someone fully without recognizing my own worth in the exchange.

It’s about loyalty, devotion, and being grounded by someone even when they don’t realize the effect they have. No matter what challenges existed, she already had me.
