I wrote “When We First Met” when I was 19. It was the first song I ever wrote.

It came from my first true love — the first time I felt something that strong and didn’t quite know what to do with it except put it into words. Everything felt intense and important. The connection. The first kiss. The way I didn’t want the moment to end.

At 19, I didn’t know much about life yet. But I knew what I felt. I believed in forever. I believed in trust. I believed that if two people cared enough, that would be enough.

Looking back now, this song is a snapshot of who I was then — hopeful, loyal, and all in. Even though it didn’t work out, it shaped me in ways I didn’t understand at the time.

It’s the sound of young love before life teaches you how complicated things can become.
