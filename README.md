# Song Stories – Scott Gross

Song stories and reflections by Scott Gross.

This repository contains the stories behind my songs.

Some of these songs were written in moments. Some sat quietly for years before being finished. All of them came from real experiences, real people, and real loss, love, and reflection.

These stories exist so that anyone who finds a song can also find its context. Not for promotion. Not for algorithms. Just for understanding.

The songs span multiple albums and periods of my life. They are not presented in chronological order. Life rarely is.
