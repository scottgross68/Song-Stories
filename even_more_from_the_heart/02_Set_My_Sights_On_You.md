Set My Sights on You was written about the moment I met Maverick’s mom, when intention replaced uncertainty.

The song is a declaration rather than a question. It speaks from the place of knowing what you want and being willing to say it plainly. The lyrics are about offering steadiness, care, and presence. Not trying to impress, not trying to compete, just showing up with honesty and consistency.

There is confidence in the song, but it is not arrogance. It comes from connection. From laughter that eases tension, from conversation that flows without effort, from feeling at home with someone without needing to explain yourself. The song captures that early realization that you want to be the person someone can count on.

Set My Sights on You is about choosing someone fully in the moment you recognize them. It does not promise perfection or a flawless future. It promises effort, loyalty, and a willingness to stand close through whatever comes next.

That clarity, and that commitment, are what the song holds.
