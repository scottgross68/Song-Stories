First Glance was written about a moment when everything changed quietly and without warning.

The song captures the instant of seeing someone for the first time and feeling an immediate pull, before names are exchanged, before intentions are clear, before there is any reason to believe it will lead anywhere. There is hesitation in the lyrics, the internal debate of whether to take a chance or let the moment pass.

The story stays inside that night. The nervousness of asking. The awareness of others nearby. The hope that the feeling might be mutual and the surprise when it is.

A slow song, an arm around a shoulder, a decision made without overthinking it. Nothing extraordinary happens outwardly, but emotionally everything shifts. The lyrics reflect the simplicity of that connection, when affection feels easy and unguarded.

First Glance is not concerned with what comes later. It does not try to protect itself from the future or explain what followed. It honors the honesty of the beginning, when love felt uncomplicated and real in the moment it arrived.
