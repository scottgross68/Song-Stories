There are relationships that begin in sunshine.
Ours rebuilt itself in the aftermath of a storm.

After we lost Maverick, we were not the same two people we had once been. Grief reshapes everything. It exposes old scars, heightens sensitivities, and tests the strength of even the deepest bonds. We stayed. We worked. We committed. For years, we believed effort and devotion would be enough.

But healing is not linear, and it is rarely synchronized.

We both carried histories that did not disappear just because we loved each other. Pain has a way of reacting before logic can catch up. I did not always respond with the steadiness she needed. And when someone has known instability before, even small tremors can feel overwhelming.

There was love. There was laughter. There were seasons that felt hopeful and grounded. But there were also patterns we could not seem to outgrow. We would mend what cracked, only to discover deeper fractures beneath the surface.

This song is not about pointing fingers. It is about recognizing that two people can give their honest effort and still find themselves worn down by the climb. Sometimes love carries you through tragedy. 
Sometimes it cannot carry you past what that tragedy changes inside you.

Parting was not about defeat. It was about acknowledging that staying was no longer bringing either of us peace.

I still honor what we built. I still respect the years we stood side by side. And I believe there is dignity in being able to say we gave it our best, even when our best did not lead us where we hoped.

Some relationships are meant to teach, to shape, to strengthen.
And sometimes the most truthful legacy they leave behind is this:
we showed up, fully, for as long as we could.
