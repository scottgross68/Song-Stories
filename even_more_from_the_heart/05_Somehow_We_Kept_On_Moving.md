Some songs are written about love at its beginning.
Some are written about love at its end.
This one is about love in survival mode.

After we lost Maverick during labor, the world did not just change. It stopped. One month later, my mom passed away too. Two losses, back to back. Two goodbyes we were never prepared to say.

Grief does something strange. It either freezes you in place or forces you to move. For us, it was movement. We packed up California, loaded everything into the back of my truck, and drove north toward the Pacific Northwest. We were not chasing adventure. We were chasing air. We needed space to breathe.

We married quietly in a small town with a 2 close friends as witnesses, no real celebration. Just two people trying to hold onto something steady in the middle of a storm. It was not about perfection. It was about survival. About choosing each other when everything else felt uncertain.

“Somehow We Kept on Moving” is not a song about blame. It is not about failure. It is about what happens when two people love each other deeply but carry grief that reshapes them. Sometimes love is enough to endure the storm. Sometimes it changes form. But that does not erase what was real.

We kept moving because stopping would have broken us completely.

Looking back, I still believe in what we had. I still believe in who we were during that season. There is no bitterness in this song. Only gratitude for the love that helped us survive something unimaginable.

Some chapters are not meant to last forever.
But they still matter.

And sometimes, the bravest thing you can do…
is keep moving.
