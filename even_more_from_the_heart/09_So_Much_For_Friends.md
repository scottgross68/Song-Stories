This song was written during a season where loyalty revealed itself in a way I never expected.

Maverick’s mom and I had separated briefly not long after we found out she was pregnant. It was a fragile time. Emotions were high. The future felt uncertain. And instead of steady support, I learned that someone I had known for over forty years was speaking about me behind my back.

Old mistakes were brought forward. Past versions of me were presented as if growth had never happened. Conversations that should have been direct were turned into whispers. And while I was trying to navigate one of the most vulnerable chapters of my life, a lifelong friend chose distance and secrecy over honesty.

What hurt the most was not disagreement. It was the refusal to speak directly. If you question a man’s character, say it to him. Give him the chance to answer. Give him the dignity of the present version of himself instead of judging him by the worst parts of his past.

“So Much for Friends” is not about revenge. It is about boundaries. It is about realizing that sometimes the ending of a friendship tells you more about its foundation than its history ever did.

I never spoke to him again. He has since passed. There was no resolution. No final conversation. Just silence.

This song captures that moment when you realize loyalty was thinner than you believed. When you understand that peace sometimes comes not from reconciliation, but from accepting who someone chose to be.

Growth is real. Change is real.
But not everyone is willing to see it.

And sometimes the hardest goodbye is not a lover.
It is a friend you thought would never cross the line.
