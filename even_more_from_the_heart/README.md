# Even More From the Heart

Even More From the Heart is the continuation of a life lived in reflection, growth, love, and loss.

This album carries both the softness of new beginnings and the weight of hard truths. Some of these songs speak to connection — the moment you first see someone and feel something shift inside you. Others speak to the reality that love does not always unfold the way we hoped it would. And still others speak to what remains when things change: dignity, growth, understanding, and strength.

There are songs here about setting your sights on someone and believing in what could be. Songs about accepting someone as they are. Songs about trying, even when trying hurts. Songs about realizing that people are not possessions, that love cannot be forced, and that sometimes the bravest thing you can do is let go.

At its core, this album is about emotional maturity. It is about loving without ownership. Caring without control. Standing steady in who you are even when the outcome is uncertain.

Even More From the Heart is not louder than the albums before it. It is deeper. It reflects a man who has learned that vulnerability is not weakness, that honesty matters, and that what we leave behind is not control — but character.

These are stories of reaching, learning, and becoming.
