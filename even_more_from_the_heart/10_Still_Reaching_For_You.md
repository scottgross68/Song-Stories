I lost my mom one month after we lost Maverick.

There is no way to properly describe what that kind of timing does to a person. You are already trying to understand how to breathe after losing a child, and then the woman who gave you life is suddenly gone too.

My mom was strength. She was fire. She was the voice that checked on me when I went quiet and the one who always believed I would find my way, even when I wasn’t sure I would.

“Still Reaching for You” came from the small moments that linger long after someone passes. Picking up the phone without thinking. Expecting to hear her voice. Realizing in the quiet that she isn’t on the other end anymore. Those habits don’t disappear just because someone does.

There is also a deeper layer to this song. Losing Maverick changed my understanding of time, fairness, and faith. Losing my mom right after made it feel like the ground beneath me had fully shifted. Two generations gone in the span of weeks.

The only thing that steadied me was belief. Belief that love does not end with a heartbeat. Belief that my son is not alone. Belief that she is holding him the way she once held me.

This song is not about answers. It is about connection. About carrying forward what she poured into me. About recognizing that even though I cannot see her, her influence is in everything I do.

Grief never completely disappears. It softens, it reshapes, but it never fully leaves. And some days, without even meaning to, I still reach for her.

And in that reaching, I’m reminded —
love outlives loss.
