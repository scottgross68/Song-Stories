Our Love Will Never Die is the second writing I ever wrote. I was young and was a believer in young and forever love. 
I wanted her to feel and know that even though there was not an opportunity for a relationship, 
that the connection meant enough to me that I was willing to keep things alive and offer my friendship for the moment.
There are moments in every relationship when love feels unbreakable. This song lives in that certainty. 
It reflects the promises we make when everything feels secure and permanent. 
It captures that belief before reality tests it.
