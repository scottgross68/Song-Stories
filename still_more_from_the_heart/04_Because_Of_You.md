Because of You sits at the root of much of my writing. The words in this song are the exact words from a Facebook post I orignally made. It was this post that inspired the creation of Box of Memories. The raw words hit differently than lyrics in verses and wanted them to be shared. 
Loss reshapes you. 
It changes how you see the world and how you express what you feel. 
Because of that love and that loss, I began writing from a deeper place. 
Some of the most meaningful songs that followed trace back to the emotions that built this one.
