title: A Moment To Fall
---

Grief does not disappear. It changes shape over time. I learned that ignoring it only made it heavier. 
A Moment to Fall is about allowing myself space to feel it without letting it consume everything. 
It is about giving pain its moment without surrendering the whole day to it.
