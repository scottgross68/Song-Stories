Look Around came from realizing how easy it is to rush into the day focused on what is missing instead of what is present. 
Life moves fast, and gratitude can slip through the cracks. 
Look Around is a reminder to pause and see what is already in front of you. 
Sometimes the shift we need is not a new opportunity, but a new perspective.
