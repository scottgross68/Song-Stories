Three Years Today was written on June 20, 2015 three years after Maverick passed.

The song speaks to a kind of loss that exists even without shared memories in the traditional sense. I never heard him cry or saw him open his eyes, yet his presence changed me completely. The moment I knew he was coming, my life shifted. I became a father in a way that does not depend on time spent, but on love felt.

The lyrics reflect the silence that followed the news and how everything changed in that instant. Even though he never took a breath in this world, he lives on in my words, my thoughts, and the person I became afterward. His existence reshaped my heart and my understanding of what it means to love.

The song acknowledges the passage of time without pretending it erases anything. People say it gets easier, and maybe parts of it do, but he is still here. In the name we chose. In dreams. In the space he occupies in my life. That space did not close. It formed me.

Three Years Today is about mourning what never had the chance to happen while honoring what still remains. The firsts that never came. The conversations that live only in imagination. And the quiet bond that never breaks.

The song ends with a promise rather than an ending. Love does not require touch or time to last. It simply is. And it stays.
