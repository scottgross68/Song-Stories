Still More From The Heart is not an album about moving on. It is an album about continuing.

These songs were written across different seasons of my life, but they share the same thread. Each one came from a moment where I had to stop, feel what was there, and then decide to keep living anyway. Not because things were resolved. Not because the pain disappeared. But because life does not pause long enough for you to catch your breath.

The album begins with love at its simplest. A first glance. A choice to take a chance. The early belief that connection can be easy and genuine. Those songs hold the innocence of beginnings, when love feels natural and unguarded, before loss teaches you how fragile everything is.

As the record unfolds, the tone shifts. Perspective deepens. Gratitude replaces complaint. Identity moves away from what is visible on the surface and settles into what is carried inside. These songs reflect the slow understanding that life is not measured by what you own or show, but by what you survive and how you continue to show up.

Grief becomes unavoidable in the middle of the album. It arrives suddenly, without permission, and refuses to follow a schedule. The songs do not try to explain it away or soften its impact. They acknowledge the reality of losing a child, losing a mother, and learning how to live in a world that looks the same but feels completely different.

There is no attempt here to rush healing. Some days require a moment to fall. Some months hurt more than others. Certain dates never loosen their grip. These songs honor that truth while still choosing forward motion. Grief is given space, but it is not allowed to take everything.

By the final track, the album stops offering statements and asks a question instead. How does one man survive this kind of life. How do you carry love, loss, responsibility, and hope in the same body without breaking. The answer is not spelled out. It lives in the act of staying. In continuing to love. In choosing to live rather than disappear.

Still More From The Heart exists because the heart does not stop giving just because it has been broken. It adapts. It stretches. It learns how to carry more than it ever wanted to.

This album is the proof of that.
