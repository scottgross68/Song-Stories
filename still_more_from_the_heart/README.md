Still More From the Heart was not written in one season. It was written across years that changed me.

This album reflects on family, loss, growth, and what remains when life does not go the way you thought it would. It speaks about becoming a father and losing a son. It honors my mom and the kind of love that gives space instead of pressure. It holds gratitude and grief in the same hands.

Some songs here are quiet. Some ask hard questions. Some simply sit in reflection. They are not written to stay in sorrow. They are written to understand it. Over time I realized that pain can shape you without owning you. Grief can deepen you without defining you.

This record moves through perspective, memory, doubt, endurance, and eventually peace. It acknowledges that certain dates and seasons never feel neutral again. It accepts that strength is not always loud. Sometimes it is simply choosing to stand up again.

By the time the final song arrives, the focus shifts from what was lost to what matters most. At the end of a life, it will not be accomplishments that define it. It will be how we loved.

Still More From the Heart is about becoming someone through what you have survived. It is about carrying memory with honesty and moving forward with intention.
