The Rain That Made Me was written when there was a stretch of life where nothing felt steady. Questions were louder than answers. 
Looking back, I can see that those storms shaped me more than the easy seasons ever did. 
This song is about recognizing that hardship can form strength. 
It is not about celebrating pain. 
It is about understanding what it built in me.
