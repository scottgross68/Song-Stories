The Rain That Made Me was written out of grief, after the loss of Maverick, during a time when the pain felt endless and unanswered.

The song begins in that place of disbelief, when the days feel heavy and the nights feel even longer. It captures the questions that come when loss hits hard. Why this happened. What it was all for. The image of crying alone on the kitchen floor reflects the private moments of grief that most people never see.

Rather than pretending strength, the lyrics are honest about how broken that season felt. I did not feel brave or in control, only committed to moving forward one step at a time. The rain becomes both literal and symbolic, representing the weight of loss and the slow process of surviving it.

As the song unfolds, the meaning shifts. What once felt like punishment begins to reveal itself as transformation. The storm did not destroy me. It reshaped me. The pain did not disappear, but it softened into understanding, patience, and a deeper sense of compassion.

The Rain That Made Me does not claim that loss is good or necessary. It simply recognizes that growth can come from suffering, even when we never asked for it. The song ends with acceptance rather than resolution, trusting that even under dark skies, something meaningful can still take root.
