People often measure others by surface details. What they drive. What they earn. How they appear. 
This song pushes back on that idea. The size of a life is not found in possessions or noise. 
It is found in love, resilience, and how someone shows up when things are difficult. 
It is personal, but it speaks to anyone who has ever felt misunderstood.
