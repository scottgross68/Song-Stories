The Month of June is about how time can change the meaning of a season without ever asking permission.

Growing up, June meant freedom. School letting out. Long days. Road trips that stretched for weeks at a time. My mom’s birthday marked the beginning of it all. We would load up the motor home and head out with no real destination, just a family chasing summer and the open road. June was loud, warm, and full of life.

Today, June carries a different weight.

The song reflects how those same memories still live inside me, but now they come with loss attached. Father’s Day with an empty seat. My mom no longer here. Maverick’s name sitting heavy on my heart. What once brought laughter now brings reflection, and sometimes pain.

June does not ease in gently. It arrives all at once, bringing back moments, dates, and absences that are impossible to ignore. Grief does not feel distant during this month. It feels close. Familiar. Present. No matter how much time has passed, June has a way of making it all feel recent again.

The song does not ask for sympathy. It simply tells the truth. Some months hurt more than others. Some memories burn brighter. And yet life still moves forward. Slowly. Carefully. One step at a time.

The Month of June is about carrying both versions of the past at once. The joy that shaped me and the loss that followed. It is about continuing on even when the season itself feels like a storm, and choosing to keep walking through it.
