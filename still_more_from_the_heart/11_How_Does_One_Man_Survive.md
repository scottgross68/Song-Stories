How Does One Man Survive was written as a question I did not have an answer to.

The song reflects the weight of carrying multiple losses at once and still being expected to keep going. It speaks to the quiet role of holding everything together while absorbing the pain of others. Loving deeply. Protecting someone else’s heart. Staying strong on the outside while unraveling internally.

The lyrics come from living inside that weight. I do not complain or ask for sympathy. I show up. I listen. I hold space for grief that is not only my own. Even as my own losses stack up, the loss of my child, the loss of my mother, the loss of people who once mattered, I keep walking forward without knowing where that path leads.

The song wrestles with doubt and self reflection. Wondering whether this is what life is meant to be. Questioning past mistakes. Carrying both guilt and goodness at the same time. Wanting peace, not perfection. Wanting to live, not just exist.

At its core, this song is about endurance. About standing in the storm without certainty that it will pass. About the fear of letting someone in when pain has already taken so much, and the loneliness that comes from guarding my heart too tightly.

How Does One Man Survive does not offer a resolution. It ends where real life often does, still asking the question. Still holding love. Still walking forward. Not because the answers are clear, but because stopping is not an option.
